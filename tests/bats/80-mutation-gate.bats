# tests/bats/80-mutation-gate.bats — the mutation gate's own verdict logic.
#
# The gate exists because the previous inline version could not fail: it ran
# `cargo mutants --in-place --jobs 4`, a flag pair cargo-mutants rejects, and
# `|| echo "::warning::"` plus `continue-on-error: true` reported a mutation
# score for a run that generated zero mutants. Testing the replacement matters
# more than usual — an untested gate is exactly what was wrong before.
#
# `cargo mutants` is stubbed on PATH so each case pins ONE decision: what the
# script concludes from a given results file. The stub writes the
# `mutants.out/outcomes.json` a real run would leave behind, so these assert the
# contract the script actually reads, not a reimplementation of it.
